Place data sources in this folder like this.
With a single source text on each line.
If you like, you can have multiple text files for organization.
Any text documents in this folder will be imported.
The better the dataset, the better the results you will get.
Just having 10 lined to work from won't produce anything good.
Try to find a way to gather at least a few hundred.
You also probably want to keep them medium length. Not too much longer than this, but also not just a few words.
